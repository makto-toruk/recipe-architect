story: My mom's "mutton" biryani is my favorite thing to eat. My family often reminds me how even when I was a baby, I would wake up to the smell of the spices and ask for "putton" (I couldn't say mutton yet). I was vegetarian for 7 years and during that time, this was the only food I really missed. I don't eat red meat much anymore, but this chicken version is quite good :) T said it was the most comforting food she's had in many weeks <3
