- Garlic cloves (8, minced)
- Onion (1 small, chopped)
- Carrot (2/3 cup, shredded)
- Crushed tomatoes (28 oz)
- Dried basil (4 teaspoons)
- Dried parsley (1 teaspoon)
- Salt and black pepper (to taste)

### For layering:

- Eggplant (1, sliced 1/8 inch thick)
- Zucchini (1, sliced 1/8 inch thick)
- Yellow squash (1, sliced 1/8 inch thick)
- Tomatoes (5, sliced 1/8 inch thick)
- Potato (1, sliced 1/8 inch thick)

**Note:** Choose vegetables with similar diameters to help with even layering.

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat.

- Cook onion, garlic, and carrot until tender (about 5 minutes).

- Add crushed tomatoes and seasonings; simmer 15 minutes until thickened.

- Pour sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish and arrange sliced vegetables in circular patterns standing upright.

- Brush vegetables with remaining olive oil. Cover and bake 30 minutes.

- Uncover and continue baking until vegetables are tender. Serve immediately.

## Notes

This recipe has been doubled from the original to fit a 9x13 inch pan. The layered vegetables create a beautiful presentation with varied colors. Works well for vegetarians and vegans.
