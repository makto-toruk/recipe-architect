## Special equipment

## Instructions

- Rinse the black beans and pick through to discard any stones or broken beans.

- Set the Instant Pot to Sauté mode (10 minutes, medium heat) and add the olive oil.

- Cook the onion, celery, carrots, and red bell pepper for 6-7 minutes until softened.

- Add the garlic and jalapeño; sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.

- Cancel Sauté mode. Add the beans, broth, water, diced tomatoes, and all spices. Stir to combine.

- Seal the pot and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.

- Allow natural pressure release for about 15 minutes.

- Remove the bay leaves. Use an immersion blender to partially puree the soup to your desired consistency.

  - Blend about 1/3 of the soup for a silky texture while keeping plenty of whole beans.

- Stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste and adjust seasoning.

- Ladle into bowls and top with diced red onion, cilantro, and avocado.
