story: These savory buns are stuffed with a spiced potato mixture (aloo palya) similar to what you might find in a masala dosa. 

  When I made this, I used half a russet potato and two medium-sized yellow potatoes for the mash. I ended up with more stuffing than could fit in the 6 buns, but it tasted great, so I just ate the extra stuffing on its own.

## Ingredients

### For the aloo palya stuffing:

- Vegetable oil (1 1/2 tsp)
- Mustard seeds (1/4 tsp)
- Cumin seeds (1/4 tsp)
- Ginger (1/4 tsp, minced)
- Curry leaves (1 tsp, finely chopped)
- Onions (1 cup, finely chopped)
- Turmeric powder (1/2 tsp)
- Asafoetida (1/4 tsp)
- Curry powder or garam masala (1/2 tsp)
- Green chilli (1, finely chopped)
- Mint leaves (2 tsp, finely chopped)
- Salt (3/4 tsp)
- Potatoes (1 1/2 cups, boiled, peeled and roughly mashed)
- Coriander leaves (2 tsp, finely chopped)

### For the bun dough:

- Warm water (1/2 cup)
- Sugar (1 tsp)
- Active dry yeast (1 1/2 tsp)
- Warm milk (1/4 cup)
- Maida or all-purpose flour (1 1/2 cups / 210g)
- Salt (1/2 tsp)
- Vegetable oil (1/2 tsp)
- Milk (2 Tbsp, for brushing)
- White sesame seeds (2 tsp, for sprinkling)
- Ghee (3 tsp, for final brushing)
- Flour (for dusting)

## Special equipment

- Stand mixer (optional)

## Instructions

- **Prepare the tempering**: Take a pan and add in the oil. When the oil is hot, add in the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, finely minced ginger, and finely chopped curry leaves. Add in the onions.
  - Ensure all ingredients are as finely chopped as possible to avoid large chunks in the final bite.

- **Make the stuffing**: Saute for a couple of minutes until the onions are soft. Add in the turmeric powder, asafoetida, curry powder (or garam masala), finely chopped green chillies, finely chopped mint leaves, and the salt. Saute for a minute.

- Add in the boiled, peeled, and roughly mashed potatoes. Mix well to combine. Cook for a minute. Add in the coriander leaves and mix well. Remove from heat and set aside.

- Once the mixture is slightly cool, make small balls from the potato mixture and set aside.

- **Activate the yeast**: Take a bowl and add in the warm water, sugar, and the yeast. Mix well with a whisk and set aside for five minutes until the yeast foams up.
  - If it doesn't foam, discard and start with fresh yeast.

- **Make the dough**: Once the yeast has foamed up, add in the milk. Add in the flour and the salt. Form a dough and knead.
  - If using a stand mixer, use speed setting 1.
  - If kneading by hand, knead for a good five minutes. The dough will be very soft and sticky.

- Dust with a little flour while kneading.
  - Do not add too much flour (no more than a couple of tablespoons) or the buns will become hard. Resist the temptation!

- **First rise**: Once the dough is smooth, transfer to an oiled bowl (coat dough with 1/2 tsp oil) and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled for at least an hour.
  - This may take longer depending on humidity.

- **Shape the buns**: Once doubled, gently deflate the dough and knead briefly. Dust with a sprinkle of flour to prevent sticking. Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Form each into a tight ball by tucking the sides into the middle until compact.
  - It is important there are no cracks while forming the dough, or the final bun will show these cracks.

- **Stuff the buns**: Take each ball, seam side up (the side with uneven edges). Flatten the ball, place a potato ball on the dough, and cover it completely. Crimp the edges tightly so it does not open while baking. Shape the ball again with your palm and set aside.
  - Pinching the dough securely after placing the stuffing is important to keep the stuffing from coming out while baking.

- **Second rise**: Brush the buns evenly with milk. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Rest the buns for 40 minutes.

- **Bake**: Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Bake the buns for 20 minutes.

- **Finish**: Remove the buns and brush with ghee or melted butter while still hot.
