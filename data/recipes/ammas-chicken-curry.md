story: Growing up, I could smell this masala from several houses away. We always called it 'chaaps'. I never knew why, and I still don't. Someone once told me it comes from 'chops,' but this is really a curry. When T and I decided to start eating meat again, this was the first thing I wanted to make. I've made it over 20 times now, but it never tastes quite like Amma's. I probably just need to be a bit more with the chili powder :)

- Cinnamon stick (1 inch)
- Salt (1 Tbsp)

## Special Equipment

- Heavy-bottomed pressure cooker or Dutch oven

## Instructions

- Clean and cut chicken into large pieces.

- Heat ghee in heavy-bottomed pressure cooker. Sauté quartered onion, garlic, and ginger until translucent. Add peppercorns, cashews, and curry leaves. Sauté for 2-3 minutes.

- Transfer the sautéed mixture to a blender along with cumin powder, red chili powder, raisins, coriander powder, garam masala, yogurt, cilantro, and mint. Blend until smooth.

- Heat butter in the pan. Sauté diced onion with fenugreek leaves, cardamom, cloves, fennel seeds, and cinnamon stick. Cook until onions are golden.

- Add chicken and salt to the tempering. Sear for 10 minutes on all sides until well-browned.

- Add the blended masala to the chicken. Simmer covered on low heat for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chicken should be tender and the curry thickened.

## Notes

- The creator notes: "I've made it over 20 times now, but it never tastes quite like Amma's. I probably just need to be a bit more with the chili powder."
- Bone-in chicken thighs provide the best flavor and stay moist during cooking
- If using a pressure cooker, you can reduce the simmering time to about 15 minutes after the first whistle
- Adjust red chili powder to taste - start with less if you prefer milder curries
- The fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) add an authentic flavor but can be omitted if unavailable
- This curry tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld together
