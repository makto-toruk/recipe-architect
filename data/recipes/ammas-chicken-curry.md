story: Growing up, I could smell this masala from several houses away. We always called it 'chaaps'. I never knew why, and I still don't. Someone once told me it comes from 'chops,' but this is really a curry. When T and I decided to start eating meat again, this was the first thing I wanted to make. Update 2026/02/15 — T came home and said she could smell it from the driveway :)

### For the masala (sautée then blend):

- Green Chillis (4)
- Onion (1/2, quartered)
- Garlic (1 1/2 bulbs)
- Ginger (2-3 inches)
- Black Peppercorns (1/2 tsp)
- Curry Leaves (1/2 cup)
- Cashews (4-5)
- Almonds (4-5)
- Oil (1 tsp, for sautéing)

### Add to blender with the sautéed mixture:

- Coriander Powder (2 tsp)
- Red Chilli Powder (1 1/2 tsp)
- Cumin Powder (1 tsp)
- Cinnamon (4-5 pieces, ~1 cm each)
- Cloves (8)
- Cardamom (3)
- Raisins (5)
- Fennel Seeds (1 tsp)
- Yogurt (4 Tbsp)
- Cilantro (1 cup)
- Mint Leaves (1/2 cup)

### For cooking:

- Ghee (1 Tbsp)
- Onion (1/2, diced)
- Chicken Thighs (2 1/2 lbs, bone-in)
- Cilantro (a handful, finely chopped)
- Mint (a handful, finely chopped)
- Salt (4 tsp)
- Turmeric (1/2 tsp)
- Kasuri Methi (1 tsp)

## Special equipment

- Heavy-bottomed pan
- Blender

## Instructions

- In 1 tsp of oil, lightly sautée the green chillis, quartered onion, garlic, ginger, peppercorns, curry leaves, cashews, and almonds for about a minute.

- Transfer to a blender along with coriander powder, red chilli powder, cumin powder, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, raisins, fennel seeds, yogurt, cilantro, and mint. Blend until smooth.

- Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add diced onion and sauté briefly.

- Add the chicken thighs, chopped cilantro, chopped mint, salt, turmeric, and kasuri methi. Cook until the chicken releases its water and is well over half cooked.

  - Don't add the masala too early or it may burn before the chicken is cooked. If you do add it early, add some water to prevent burning.

- Add the blended masala and continue cooking until the chicken reaches 170°F internal temperature.
