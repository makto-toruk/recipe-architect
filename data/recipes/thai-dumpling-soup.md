## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 5 servings
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes
- **Cook time:** 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- avocado oil (2 Tbsp)
- 2 shallots (or 1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced)
- bell pepper (1 green, thinly sliced)
- 1 inch ginger (galangal works even better)
- garlic (6 cloves, crushed)
- 6 Thai chilis (reduce if you prefer less heat)
- red curry paste (3 Tbsp)
- 8 oz mushrooms (white or cremini, sliced)
- 1 block tofu (soft or medium-firm, cubed)
- 1 cup coconut milk (light or full-fat)
- soy sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp)
- rice vinegar (2 Tbsp)
- brown sugar (1 Tbsp)
- 1 Tbsp salt (plus more to taste)
- 1 pack frozen gyozas (~16 dumplings)

## Instructions

- Crush ginger, garlic, and chiles with salt using mortar and pestle to form a coarse paste.

- Heat avocado oil in pot over medium heat. Sauté shallots for about 2 minutes until translucent. Add bell pepper and sauté 2 minutes more.

- Reduce heat to low and add the ginger-garlic-chili paste. Sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in red curry paste and cook on low, stirring constantly, for 4-5 minutes until the raw aroma dissipates.

- Add mushrooms, season with salt, and sauté until they release their moisture.

- Pour in about 5 cups hot water and bring to a boil. Stir in coconut milk, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and brown sugar. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Return to a gentle boil.

- Gently add cubed tofu and return to a simmer. Add frozen gyozas, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes until heated through.

- Serve hot.

## Notes

**Description:** Comforting red-curry soup with tofu and gyozas.

**Storage tip:** For leftovers, reheat the broth and add fresh gyozas just before serving so they stay intact.

**Heat level:** The recipe calls for 6 Thai chilis - reduce the amount if you prefer less heat.

**Ginger substitute:** Galangal works even better than regular ginger if you can find it.
