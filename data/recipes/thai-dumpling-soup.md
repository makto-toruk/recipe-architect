## Ingredients

- Avocado oil (2 Tbsp)
- Shallots (2, thinly slices; or 1/2 large red onion)
- Green bell pepper (1, thinly sliced)
- Ginger (1 inch, galangal works even better)
- Garlic (6 cloves, crushed)
- Thai chilis (6, reduce if you prefer less heat)
- Red curry paste (3 Tbsp)
- Mushrooms (8 oz, white or cremini, sliced)
- Tofu (1 block, soft or medium-firm, cubed)
- Coconut milk (1 cup, light or full-fat)
- Soy sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp)
- Rice vinegar (2 Tbsp)
- Brown sugar (1 Tbsp)
- Salt (1 Tbsp, plus more to taste)
- Frozen gyozas (1 pack, ~16 dumplings)

## Instructions

- Crush ginger, garlic, and chiles with salt using mortar and pestle to form a coarse paste.

- Heat avocado oil in pot over medium heat. Sauté shallots for about 2 minutes until translucent. Add bell pepper and sauté 2 minutes more.

- Reduce heat to low and add the ginger-garlic-chili paste. Sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in red curry paste and cook on low, stirring constantly, for 4-5 minutes until the raw aroma dissipates.

- Add mushrooms, season with salt, and sauté until they release their moisture.

- Pour in about 5 cups hot water and bring to a boil. Stir in coconut milk, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and brown sugar. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Return to a gentle boil.

- Gently add cubed tofu and return to a simmer. Add frozen gyozas, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes until heated through.

  - Add only as many gyozas as you'll serve immediately; when reheating leftovers, drop in fresh frozen gyozas so they stay intact.

- Serve hot.
  - For leftovers, reheat the broth and add fresh gyozas just before serving so they stay intact.
