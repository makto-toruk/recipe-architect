## Ingredients

- Butternut squash (3 lb, I use two bags of TJ's pre-cut)
- Sweet onion (1 medium, sliced to 1/2")
- Celery (2 stalks, sliced into 1" pieces)
- Garlic cloves (1 bulb, peeled and smashed)
- Olive oil (3 Tbsp)
- Kosher salt (1 tsp)
- Ground black pepper (1/2 tsp)
- Fresh thyme and sage (1 sprig, or dry 1 tsp each)
- Bay leaf (1)
- Low sodium broth (3-4 cups, chicken or vegetable or water)
- Pomegranate aril (for garnish)

## Instructions

- Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Sauté until tender, about 5-8 minutes.

- Add squash and celery to the pot. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften.

- Add garlic, thyme, sage, and bay leaf. Stir and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant.

- Add 3 cups of broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-30 minutes, until squash is completely tender.

- Remove bay leaf. Let soup cool slightly, then transfer to a blender in batches. Blend until smooth and creamy.

- Return soup to pot. If too thick, add remaining broth as needed for desired consistency. Adjust seasoning to taste.

- Serve immediately, garnished with pomegranate aril and fresh thyme.
