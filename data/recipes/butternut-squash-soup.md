## Ingredients

- Butternut squash (3 medium, peeled and diced)
- Sweet onion (1 medium, sliced to 1/2")
- Celery (1 heart, sliced into 1" pieces)
- Garlic cloves (1 bulb, peeled and smashed)
- Avocado oil (3 Tbsp, divided)
- Kosher salt (1 tsp)
- Ground black pepper (1/2 tsp)
- Fresh thyme and sage (1 sprig, or dry 1 tsp each)
- Bay leaves (2)
- Low sodium chicken stock (4 cups)
- Water (2 cups)
- Pomegranate aril (for garnish)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 375°F (fan on). Toss diced squash with 2 Tbsp avocado oil, salt, and pepper on a sheet pan. Roast for 20 minutes, stir, then roast another 10-15 minutes until tender and caramelized.

- Heat 1 Tbsp avocado oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5-8 minutes.

- Add garlic, stir and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant.

- Add celery, thyme, sage, and bay leaves. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.

- Add roasted squash, chicken stock, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5-10 minutes.

- Remove bay leaves. Let soup cool slightly, then transfer to a blender in batches. Blend until smooth and creamy.

  - Be patient here. Adjust seasoning. The difference between a 5 on 10 and 8 on 10 soup is the seasoning.

- Serve, garnished with pomegranate aril and fresh thyme.
