      "step": 1,
      "text": "In a large mixer or food processor, place flour, salt, sugar, and ghee and mix for 10 seconds.",
      "note": "It is crucial that none of the ingredients are warm enough to melt the butter. The resulting mixture appears sandy. On warm days, chill flour for 30 minutes before using."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "text": "Cut the butter into small chunks and add to the mixture. Pulse in 1-second increments until the butter is pea-sized.",
      "note": "Typically 3 pulses, a gentle mix with a fork, then another pulse."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "text": "Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl and add water in 4 to 5 additions, mixing with a fork after each addition.",
      "note": "Don't knead the dough. Instead use a scraper to gently press it together."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "text": "Move the dough onto plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and chill for 2 hours before rolling."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "text": "Cut the chilled dough into two pieces, lightly flour, and roll out one piece at a time."
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "text": "Quarter turn and roll to keep a round shape; press and repair any edge cracks as you go."
    },
    {
      "step": 7,
      "text": "Roll the dough at least 4 inches larger than the pie pan."
    },
    {
      "step": 8,
      "text": "Place the dough in the pie pan, patch any cracks, and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling."
    },
    {
      "step": 9,
      "text": "Prepare your filling and let it cool completely before filling the crust."
    },
    {
      "step": 10,
      "text": "If making a double crust, trim and cut ventilation holes in the top dough, then crimp the edges.",
      "note": "Edges may bake thick but will be super flaky."
    },
    {
      "step": 11,
      "text": "Bake at 400Â°F for 60 minutes.",
      "note": "We've never had a soggy bottom when the crust is cold at assembly."
