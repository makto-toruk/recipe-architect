## Ingredients

### Flaky pie crust:

- All-purpose flour (2 1/2 cups)
- Salt (1 tsp)
- White granulated sugar (1 Tbsp)
- Ghee (2 Tbsp)
- Unsalted butter (3/4 cup, chilled)
- Cold water (5/8 cup, which is 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp)

### Pecan pie filling:

- Pecans (2 1/2 cups, chopped or halves)
- Eggs (3 large, room temperature)
- Maple syrup (1/2 cup)
- Salt (3/4 tsp)
- Brown sugar (3/4 cup)
- Vanilla extract (1 Tbsp)
- Unsalted butter (1/2 cup, melted and cooled)

## Instructions

- Mix flour, salt, sugar, and ghee in a bowl. Pulse in chilled butter until mixture resembles pea-sized pieces. Add cold water gradually until dough comes together. Chill for 2 hours. Roll out and place in pie pan.

- Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add maple syrup, salt, brown sugar, and vanilla extract, whisking to combine. While whisking continuously, stream in the melted and cooled butter. Add pecans to the prepared crust, then pour the filling mixture over the pecans.

- First, bake the prepared crust at 400°F for 60 minutes until lightly golden. Add the filling, then bake the filled pie at 375°F (with fan on) for 50-60 minutes. The pie is done when it's set but still slightly jiggly in the center.

- Cool the pie completely before cutting. For serving, you can invert and cut into squares for a unique presentation.

## Notes

- Make sure eggs are at room temperature for better incorporation
- The butter for the filling should be melted and cooled to avoid cooking the eggs
- The pie should still have a slight jiggle in the center when done - it will continue to set as it cools
- Store covered at room temperature for 2-3 days or refrigerate for up to 5 days
