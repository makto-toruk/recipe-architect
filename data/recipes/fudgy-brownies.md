## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 9 squares
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes
- **Cook time:** 35 minutes
- **Pan/Dish size:** 8x8-inch square pan

## Ingredients

- Dark chocolate (170g, 70-72% cocoa recommended)
- Cacao powder (1/4 cup)
- Unsalted butter (1/2 cup or 1 stick, room temperature)
- White granulated sugar (3/4 cup)
- Brown sugar (1/3 cup)
- Eggs (3)
- All-purpose flour (5/8 cup or 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp)
- Salt (1 pinch)

## Special Equipment

- Double boiler or heat-proof bowl over simmering water
- 8x8-inch baking pan

## Instructions

- Melt chocolate and butter together using a double boiler (heat-proof bowl over simmering water). Avoid microwaving as butter melts faster and may burn the chocolate.

- Whisk sugars into the hot chocolate mixture gradually. Some sugar crystals may remain - this is normal.

- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

- Whisk in eggs one at a time. This requires vigorous whisking to fully incorporate each egg.

- Sift together salt, flour, and cacao powder. Fold the dry mixture into the batter until just combined.

- Line an 8x8-inch pan with greased parchment or baking paper. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes at 350°F. The surface may appear slightly gooey even when done.

- Allow brownies to cool completely in the pan. Invert onto a cutting board and cut into 9 squares.

## Notes

- The brownies will have a fudgy, gooey texture - this is intentional! The surface remains slightly gooey even after cooling.
- Using high-quality dark chocolate (70-72% cocoa) makes a significant difference in the final flavor.
