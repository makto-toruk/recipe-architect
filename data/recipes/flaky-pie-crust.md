## Ingredients

- All-purpose flour (2 1/2 cups)
- Salt (1 tsp)
- White granulated sugar (1 Tbsp)
- Ghee (2 Tbsp)
- Unsalted butter (3/4 cup, chilled)
- Cold water (5/8 cup, which is 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp)

## Instructions

- In a large mixer or food processor, place flour, salt, sugar, and ghee and mix for 10 seconds.

   - It is crucial that none of the ingredients are warm enough to melt the butter. The resulting mixture appears sandy. On warm days, chill flour for 30 minutes before using.

- Cut the butter into small chunks and add to the mixture. Pulse in 1-second increments until the butter is pea-sized.

   - Typically 3 pulses, a gentle mix with a fork, then another pulse.

- Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl and add water in 4 to 5 additions, mixing with a fork after each addition.

   - Don't knead the dough. Instead use a scraper to gently press it together.

- Move the dough onto plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and chill for 2 hours before rolling.

- Cut the chilled dough into two pieces, lightly flour, and roll out one piece at a time.

- Quarter turn and roll to keep a round shape; press and repair any edge cracks as you go.

- Roll the dough at least 4 inches larger than the pie pan.

- Place the dough in the pie pan, patch any cracks, and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling.

- Prepare your filling and let it cool completely before filling the crust.

- If making a double crust, trim and cut ventilation holes in the top dough, then crimp the edges.
  - Edges may bake thick but will be super flaky.

- Bake at 400°F for 60 minutes.
  - We've never had a soggy bottom when the crust is cold at assembly.
