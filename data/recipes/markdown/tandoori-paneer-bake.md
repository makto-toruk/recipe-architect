### Other Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (or finely grate 1-inch piece ginger + 4-5 garlic cloves)
- 2 tbsp melted butter or ghee (divided)
- ½ tsp paprika mixed with butter (for basting)
- Fresh coriander for garnish
- Wooden or metal skewers

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Paneer

- If using store-bought paneer, press it gently between paper towels to remove excess moisture
- Cut into 1.5-inch cubes
- Set aside

### 2. Make the Marinade

- In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and all the spice rub ingredients
- Add paneer cubes and bell pepper pieces
- Gently toss to coat everything evenly
- Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours

### 3. Assemble the Skewers

- If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning
- Thread paneer cubes and bell peppers alternately onto skewers
- Add onion chunks between them if desired

### 4. Prepare to Bake

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
- Line a baking tray with parchment paper or lightly oil it
- Place skewers on the tray, leaving space between them
- Drizzle with 1 tbsp melted butter

### 5. Bake the Skewers

- Bake for 15 minutes
- Mix remaining melted butter with ½ tsp sweet paprika
- Remove from oven, flip skewers, and baste with the paprika butter
- Return to oven and bake for another 8-10 minutes until edges are lightly charred and peppers are tender

### 6. Broil (Optional)

- For extra char, broil on high for 2-3 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning

## Serving

- Garnish with fresh coriander
- Serve hot with naan, rice, or as an appetizer
- Can also serve with mint chutney or raita

## Notes

Paneer absorbs flavors quickly but doesn't need as long to marinate as chicken. Don't over-marinate or it may become too soft. The yogurt-based marinade creates a beautiful tandoori-style crust when baked. Bell peppers add sweetness and color to complement the spiced paneer.
