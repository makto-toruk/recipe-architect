## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 2 pie crusts
- **First Made:** December 19, 2021

## Ingredients

- All-purpose flour (2 1/2 cups)
- Salt (1 tsp)
- White granulated sugar (1 Tbsp)
- Ghee (2 Tbsp)
- Unsalted butter (3/4 cup, chilled)
- Cold water (5/8 cup, which is 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp)

## Instructions

### 1. Mix dry ingredients

In a large mixer or food processor, place flour, salt, sugar, and ghee and mix for 10 seconds.

(It is crucial that none of the ingredients are warm enough to melt the butter. The resulting mixture appears sandy. On warm days, chill flour for 30 minutes before using.)

### 2. Add butter

Cut the butter into small chunks and add to the mixture. Pulse in 1-second increments until the butter is pea-sized.

(Typically 3 pulses, a gentle mix with a fork, then another pulse.)

### 3. Add water

Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl and add water in 4 to 5 additions, mixing with a fork after each addition.

(Don't knead the dough. Instead use a scraper to gently press it together.)

### 4. Chill the dough

Move the dough onto plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and chill for 2 hours before rolling.

### 5. Roll out the dough

Cut the chilled dough into two pieces, lightly flour, and roll out one piece at a time.

### 6. Shape the crust

Quarter turn and roll to keep a round shape; press and repair any edge cracks as you go.

### 7. Size appropriately

Roll the dough at least 4 inches larger than the pie pan.

### 8. Place in pan

Place the dough in the pie pan, patch any cracks, and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling.

### 9. Prepare filling

Prepare your filling and let it cool completely before filling the crust.

### 10. Finish the crust

If making a double crust, trim and cut ventilation holes in the top dough, then crimp the edges.

(Edges may bake thick but will be super flaky.)

### 11. Bake

Bake at 400°F for 60 minutes.

(We've never had a soggy bottom when the crust is cold at assembly.)

## Notes

- The key to a flaky crust is keeping everything cold - chill the flour on warm days
- Don't overwork the dough when adding water
- The butter should remain in pea-sized pieces for maximum flakiness
- Always let the filling cool completely before adding to the crust
