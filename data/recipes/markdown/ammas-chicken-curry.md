story: Growing up, I could smell this masala from several houses away. We always called it 'chaaps'. I never knew why, and I still don't. Someone once told me it comes from 'chops,' but this is really a curry. When T and I decided to start eating meat again, this was the first thing I wanted to make. I've made it over 20 times now, but it never tastes quite like Amma's. I probably just need to be a bit more with the chili powder :)

## Notes

- The creator notes: "I've made it over 20 times now, but it never tastes quite like Amma's. I probably just need to be a bit more with the chili powder."
- Bone-in chicken thighs provide the best flavor and stay moist during cooking
- If using a pressure cooker, you can reduce the simmering time to about 15 minutes after the first whistle
- Adjust red chili powder to taste - start with less if you prefer milder curries
- The fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) add an authentic flavor but can be omitted if unavailable
- This curry tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld together
