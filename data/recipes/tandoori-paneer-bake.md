## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 3-4
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes (plus 30 minutes to 2 hours marinating)
- **Cook time:** 20-25 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the Paneer Marinade:

- Paneer (1 lb, cut into 1.5-inch cubes)
- Plain yogurt (3/4 cup)
- Lemon juice (2 tbsp)

### For the Spice Rub:

- Tandoori masala (1 1/2 tsp, start with 1 tsp if yours is spicy)
- Light brown sugar (1/2 tsp, optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper (1/4 tsp)
- Garam masala powder (1/2 tsp)
- Ground cumin (1/2 tsp, jeera)
- Ground coriander (1/2 tsp, dhania)
- Kasoori methi (1/2 tsp, crushed dried fenugreek leaves)
- Sweet paprika (1/2 tsp, or Kashmiri red chilli powder for color)
- Salt (1/2 tsp or to taste)

### Other Ingredients:

- Bell peppers (2, any color, cut into 1.5-inch pieces)
- Onion (1 medium, cut into chunks, optional for skewers)
- Ginger-garlic paste (1 tbsp, or finely grate 1-inch piece ginger + 4-5 garlic cloves)
- Melted butter or ghee (2 tbsp, divided)
- Paprika mixed with butter (1/2 tsp, for basting)
- Fresh coriander for garnish

## Special Equipment

- Wooden or metal skewers

## Instructions

- If using store-bought paneer, press it gently between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Cut into 1.5-inch cubes and set aside.

- In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and all the spice rub ingredients. Add paneer cubes and bell pepper pieces. Gently toss to coat everything evenly. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

- If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning. Thread paneer cubes and bell peppers alternately onto skewers. Add onion chunks between them if desired.

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper or lightly oil it. Place skewers on the tray, leaving space between them. Drizzle with 1 tbsp melted butter.

- Bake for 15 minutes. Mix remaining melted butter with ½ tsp sweet paprika. Remove from oven, flip skewers, and baste with the paprika butter. Return to oven and bake for another 8-10 minutes until edges are lightly charred and peppers are tender.

- (Optional) For extra char, broil on high for 2-3 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.

## Serving

- Garnish with fresh coriander
- Serve hot with naan, rice, or as an appetizer
- Can also serve with mint chutney or raita

## Notes

Paneer absorbs flavors quickly but doesn't need as long to marinate as chicken. Don't over-marinate or it may become too soft. The yogurt-based marinade creates a beautiful tandoori-style crust when baked. Bell peppers add sweetness and color to complement the spiced paneer.
