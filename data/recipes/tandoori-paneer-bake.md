## Ingredients

### For the marinade

- Paneer (1 lb, cut into 1.5-inch cubes)
- Plain yogurt (3/4 cup)
- Lemon juice (2 Tbsp)
- Ginger-garlic paste (1 Tbsp, or finely grate 1-inch piece ginger + 4-5 garlic cloves)
- Tandoori masala (1 1/2 tsp, start with 1 tsp if yours is spicy)
- Light brown sugar (1/2 tsp, optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper (1/4 tsp)
- Garam masala powder (1/2 tsp)
- Ground cumin (1/2 tsp, jeera)
- Ground coriander (1/2 tsp, dhania)
- Kasoori methi (1/2 tsp, crushed dried fenugreek leaves)
- Sweet paprika (1/2 tsp, or Kashmiri red chilli powder for color)
- Salt (1/2 tsp or to taste)

### Other ingredients:

- Bell peppers (2, any color, cut into 1.5-inch pieces)
- Onion (1 medium, cut into chunks, optional for skewers)
- Melted butter or ghee (1 Tbsp)
- Fresh coriander (for garnish)

## Special equipment

- Wooden or metal skewers

## Instructions

- If using store-bought paneer, press it gently between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Cut into 1.5-inch cubes and set aside.

- In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, tandoori masala, brown sugar, black pepper, garam masala, ground cumin, ground coriander, kasoori methi, paprika, and salt. Mix well. Add paneer cubes and bell pepper pieces. Gently toss to coat everything evenly. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

- Thread paneer cubes and bell peppers alternately onto skewers. Add onion chunks between them if desired.

- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ghee. Working in batches if needed, sear skewers for a few minutes on each side until paneer develops a golden crust. Remove and set aside.

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper or lightly oil it. Place seared skewers on the tray, leaving space between them.

- Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and flip skewers. Return to oven and bake for another 8-10 minutes until edges are lightly charred and peppers are tender.

- Turn oven to broil and broil for 2-3 minutes to get extra char. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
