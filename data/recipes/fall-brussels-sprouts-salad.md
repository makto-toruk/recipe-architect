  When my husband asked for a shaved Brussels sprouts salad for Thanksgiving, I researched a few recipes and created this version. It ended up being one of the most popular dishes on the table.

## Ingredients

### For the salad:

- Brussels sprouts (8 cups)
- Butternut squash (4 cups)
- Honeycrisp or Pink Lady apple (1, any variety which is slightly tart and sweet)
- Red onion (1/2)
- Roasted pumpkin seeds (1/4 cup)
- Toasted walnuts (1/4 cup, slivered almonds or pecans would be a good alternative)
- Crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese (4 oz)

### For the dressing:

- Dijon mustard (2 tsp)
- Italian seasoning or mixed dried herbs (1 tsp)
- Honey (1 tsp)
- Olive oil (2 Tbsp)
- Lemon (1 large, juiced)
- Apple cider vinegar (1 Tbsp, for extra tang)
- Salt (1 tsp, adjust to taste)

## Special equipment

- Food processor (for shaving Brussels sprouts)
- Mason jar (for making dressing)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350°F. Slice the Brussels sprouts using a food processor and spread on a baking sheet. Bake until tender, about 25-30 minutes or longer if required. Some bits can become crispy and will add a nice texture to the salad.

- Peel and cut butternut squash into cubes. Spread on a separate baking sheet and bake until tender and some bits are caramelized, about 25-30 minutes.

  - You can use pre-cut squash from Trader Joe's to save time.

- While the vegetables are roasting, slice red onion and soak in ice cold water for about 15 minutes to reduce the acidity. Drain before using.

- Make the dressing by adding all the ingredients into a mason jar and giving it a good shake until smooth and creamy.

- Cut apple into slices or cubes.

  - I recommend cutting the apple when you're ready to combine the salad so it doesn't oxidize.

- Once the roasted vegetables are completely cooled, combine them with the apple, drained red onion, roasted nuts, and goat cheese in a large bowl.

- Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Make sure the roasted vegetables are completely cooled before combining all the ingredients to prevent wilting.
- The salad can be prepped ahead by roasting the vegetables and making the dressing in advance. Store separately and combine just before serving.
- For a vegan version, omit the goat cheese or substitute with a plant-based alternative.
