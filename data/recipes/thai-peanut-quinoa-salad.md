## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 8
- **Prep time:** 20 minutes
- **Cook time:** 20 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the Salad:

- uncooked quinoa or millet (1 1/2 cups)
- water (3 cups)
- shredded purple cabbage (4 cups)
- grated carrot (2 cups)
- chopped cilantro (1 cup)
- thinly sliced green onion (1/2 cup)
- 1/2 cup chopped roasted and salted peanuts (for garnish)

### For the Peanut Sauce:

- smooth peanut butter (1/2 cup)
- reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce (6 tablespoons)
- maple syrup or honey (2 tablespoons)
- rice vinegar (2 tablespoons)
- toasted sesame oil (2 teaspoons)
- grated fresh ginger (2 teaspoons)
- lime, juiced (1)
- red pepper flakes (1/4 teaspoon)

## Instructions

- Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh colander. Combine with 3 cups water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water is absorbed (about 10-15 minutes). Remove from heat, cover, and let rest 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cool.

- Whisk peanut butter and tamari together until smooth (microwave briefly if needed to make mixing easier). Add remaining sauce ingredients (maple syrup, rice vinegar, sesame oil, grated ginger, lime juice, and red pepper flakes) and whisk until smooth. Add water a tablespoon at a time if the sauce is too thick.

- Combine cooked quinoa, cabbage, carrot, cilantro, and green onion in a large bowl. Pour in the peanut sauce and toss well to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (add more tamari for saltiness, lime for acidity, or maple syrup for sweetness).

- Divide salad into bowls and garnish with chopped peanuts.

## Notes

- Keeps refrigerated for about 4 days
- Store peanuts separately to prevent sogginess
- Can substitute millet for quinoa if preferred
- For a spicier version, increase red pepper flakes or add sriracha to the sauce
