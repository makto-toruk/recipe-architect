## Ingredients

### Chicken and Marinade:

- Boneless, skinless chicken thighs (2 1/2 lbs)
- Avocado oil (2 Tbsp)
- Salt (2 tsp)
- Black pepper (1 tsp)
- Yogurt (1/2 cup)
- Lemon (1/2, juiced)
- Garlic powder (1 1/2 Tbsp)

- Cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp)
- Turmeric powder (1/2 tsp)
- Cumin powder (1/2 tsp)
- Garam masala (1/2 tsp)
- Red onion (1/2, thinly sliced)

## Instructions

- Clean chicken thighs and place in a large bowl. Add oil, salt, pepper, yogurt, and lemon juice. Stir to combine.

- Mix in all spices (garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and garam masala) to evenly coat the chicken. Add sliced onion and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, preferably overnight.

- Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Pack chicken and onions tightly into a loaf pan.

- Bake uncovered for 45 minutes until fully cooked with a crispy top. Internal temperature should reach 165°F.
