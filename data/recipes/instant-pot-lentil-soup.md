## Ingredients

- Olive oil (2 Tbsp)
- Sweet onion (1 medium, diced to 1/2")
- Carrots (2 medium, diced to 1/2")
- Celery (2 stalks, thinly sliced)
- Garlic (4 cloves, minced)
- Dried sage (1 tsp)
- Dried thyme (1/2 tsp)
- Yukon gold potatoes (4 small, about 12 oz, cut into 1" chunks)
- Crushed tomatoes (28 oz can)
- Brown or green lentils (1 cup, rinsed)
- Vegetable stock (1 quart)
- Kosher salt (to taste)
- Fresh parsley (chopped, for garnish)

### Optional:

- Kale (1 bunch, stemmed)

## Special equipment

- Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker

## Instructions

- Rinse and sort 1 cup lentils through a mesh strainer, removing any debris.

- Set Instant Pot to sauté mode. Add olive oil, then sauté onion, carrots, and celery until onions turn translucent, about 6 minutes.

- Add garlic and sage, sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.

- Cancel sauté mode. Add potatoes, crushed tomatoes, lentils, and vegetable stock. Stir well to combine.

- Seal the pot and set the vent to "Sealing." Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.

- Allow natural pressure release, or use quick release if short on time.

- Season with salt to taste.

  - Add salt after cooking, not before. Salt added before cooking can toughen legumes.

- Optional: Stir in stemmed kale after pressure release and simmer for 5 minutes until wilted.

- Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.

  - Stores refrigerated up to 5 days, or frozen up to 2 months. Reheat on stovetop over medium-low heat.
