- Chaat masala (1/2 tsp)
- Sugar (1 tsp)
- Salt (1/4 tsp)
- Freshly crushed black pepper
- Chopped coriander leaves
- Grated cucumber (optional, squeeze out water before adding)

## Instructions

- Blend fresh ginger, garlic, and an optional green chili with about 1/3 cup of water to a smooth paste. Add more water if needed for a fine paste.

- Use Shan Biryani Masala (the one simply labeled "Biryani Masala" or "Pulao Biryani Masala," not "Bombay Biryani Masala" due to its spiciness). Remove whole spices from the Biryani Masala and place them in a tea strainer or cheesecloth for later use in cooking the rice.

- In a bowl, combine plain unflavored yogurt, Kashmiri red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference), turmeric powder, ground coriander, Shan Biryani Masala (2-3 tablespoons), salt, and oil. Stir well until smooth. Add large pieces of chicken on the bone (thighs and drumsticks are recommended, not boneless chicken) to the mixture. Add chopped coriander leaves and torn mint leaves. Finally, add the prepared ginger garlic paste. Mix everything thoroughly and let it marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.

- Slice brown onions of relatively equal thickness. Add a teaspoon of salt to the sliced onions to help draw out moisture, then let them sit for 10-15 minutes.

- Crush a few strands of saffron and add them to warm milk along with 2 teaspoons of Kewra water (or a few drops of Kewra essence, or rose water). Mix a tiny pinch of yellow food color with 2 tablespoons of water (this step is optional).

- Use good quality long-grained Basmati rice. Rinse the rice several times until the water runs clear to remove surface starch. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain all the water. Set a timer to avoid over-soaking, which can cause grains to break.

- Heat oil (don't be stingy with the oil) in a large, wide, heavy-bottomed pot. Ensure the oil is just warm, not too hot. Squeeze out as much water as possible from the salted onions before adding them to the oil. Stir on medium-high heat, then lower to medium once the edges start browning. Stir continuously until they reach a beautiful golden brown color. Be quick, as they darken rapidly. Switch off the heat and immediately remove the browned onions, placing them on a plate lined with paper towels. Loosen them out with a fork and press lightly with another paper towel to remove excess oil.

- Heat the same pot with the remaining oil on medium. Add the marinated chicken and two dry bay leaves. Stir on medium heat until the juices come to a boil. Stir on high heat for 10 minutes. Add 5 raw potatoes (optional, but common in some regions) and half of the browned onions. Add 1 teaspoon of garam masala powder. Cover with a lid and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes until potatoes are soft and chicken is cooked through (but not falling off the bone). Skim off the oil from the top of the curry; save it for layering.

- In a large pot, bring a generous amount of water to a boil. Add the whole spices collected from the Biryani Masala (in the tea strainer), or if using different masala, add green cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves, and Shahi jeera (optional). Also add two dry bay leaves. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to prevent sticking and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar/lemon juice for shine and to prevent breaking. Add about 1 tablespoon of salt. Once the water boils, remove the tea strainer. Add the drained rice. Keep the heat high initially, then lower to medium once the water bubbles. Stir gently from time to time. Taste frequently: the rice needs to be 70% cooked, still slightly chewy but not too chewy. Once 70% cooked, turn off the heat, drain the rice, discard bay leaves, and gently spread out the rice with a fork.

- Add a small amount of browned onions to the bottom of the pot with the chicken. Loosely scatter half of the cooked rice on top. Add some chopped coriander and mint leaves. Add the rest of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining chopped coriander and mint leaves. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Biryani Masala. Pour in the saffron milk mixed with Kewra water. Add 2-3 whole green/red chilies (optional). Pour the skimmed-off curry oil (or melted ghee) over the layers. Make small holes on the surface of the rice and add the food color in these holes (optional) to create varying shades of yellow rice. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the rest of the browned onions. Place a tight-fitting lid on top, or cover the pot with aluminum foil before putting on the lid.

- Place a flame tamer, cast iron pan, or any flat pan on the burner to prevent the bottom from burning. Switch heat to high for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, lower the heat to the lowest possible level for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner. Allow the Biryani to rest for at least 30 minutes before opening the lid to allow the residual heat to fluff up the rice. The longer it rests, the fluffier it gets.

- Open the lid and gently spoon out the Biryani using a flat spoon, working from top to bottom to mix the layers. The chicken can be deboned before serving if desired.

- Heat a pan on medium heat and add a little less than a teaspoon of cumin seeds. Stir on low heat until fragrant; do not let them turn too dark. Crush the roasted cumin seeds using a mortar and pestle or rolling pin. Beat 1/2 cup of plain unflavored yogurt until smooth. Add the crushed cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, freshly crushed black pepper, and chopped coriander leaves to the yogurt. Taste and adjust seasonings. Grated cucumber (squeezed of water) can also be added.

## Serving

Serve hot with raita on the side.

## Notes

- Always use less rice compared to the weight of chicken
- The recipe uses Shan Biryani Masala - store leftover in an airtight container in the refrigerator for future use
- Use "Biryani Masala" or "Pulao Biryani Masala" from Shan, not "Bombay Biryani Masala" (too spicy)
- If using Sella Basmati rice, soak for over an hour instead of 30 minutes
- Brown onions are recommended for best flavor
- Potatoes are optional in the curry
- Kewra water or Rose water can be used for the layering - choose based on preference
- Food coloring is totally optional
- Always taste raita and adjust seasonings accordingly
- Don't be stingy with oil when browning onions
- The biryani must rest for at least 30 minutes after cooking - the longer it rests, the fluffier it gets
- Use chicken on bones (thighs and drumsticks), not boneless chicken
- Rice should be cooked to only 70% - it will finish cooking during the dum process
- A flame tamer or flat pan under the pot prevents burning during dum cooking
