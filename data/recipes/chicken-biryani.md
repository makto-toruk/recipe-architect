## Ingredients

- Ghee (2 Tbsp, or oil)
- Dry bay leaves (2)
- Garam masala powder (1 tsp)
- Warm milk with saffron strands (1/2 cup, crushed and soaked)
- Rose water (2 tsp)
- Onion (475 g)
- Melted ghee (2 Tbsp, or skimmed out oil from curry)
- Chopped coriander leaves (a handful)
- Mint leaves (10 to 15)
- Biryani Masala (1 Tbsp)
- Lemon juice (1 Tbsp)

### Marinade

- Chicken (2.5 lbs, use large bone-in pieces)
- Ginger (25 g)
- Garlic (1 bulb)
- Green chilli (1, optional)
- Water (1/3 cup)
- Plain yogurt (1 cup)
- Kashmiri red chilli powder (2 tsp)
- Turmeric powder (1 tsp)
- Coriander powder (2 tsp)
- Shan Biryani Masala (2 Tbsp)
- Salt (1 tsp)
- Oil (1 Tbsp)
- Chopped coriander leaves (2 Tbsp, cilantro)
- Mint leaves (3 to 4)

### Rice

- Long grained Basmati rice (600 gm, rinsed till water runs clear and soaked for 30 mins, if using Sella Basmati soak for over an hour)
- Salt (1 Tbsp)
- Dry bay leaves (2)
- Shan Biryani Masala whole spices (from earlier)

## Instructions

### Marinate the chicken

- Blend fresh ginger, garlic, and an optional green chili with about 1/3 cup of water to a smooth paste.

- Remove whole spices from Shan Biryani Masala and set aside for rice.

- In a bowl, combine yogurt, Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder, ground coriander, Shan Biryani Masala, salt, and oil. Stir well until smooth. Add chicken, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves to the mixture. Finally, add the prepared ginger garlic paste. Mix everything thoroughly and let it marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.

  - We usually marinate this overnight.

- Slice brown onions of relatively equal thickness. Bake them on a sheet tray (20-30 minutes) until caramelized and golden brown. Set aside and let cool.

  - Traditionally, this is fried in a lot of oil. We find this to be time consuming, and just not worth the additional effort. When the sheet tray is not overcrowded, the results are very similar.

- Crush a few strands of saffron and add them to warm milk along with rose water.

- Rinse rice until water runs clear. Soak 30 minutes, then drain.

  - Set a timer to avoid over-soaking, which can cause grains to break.

### Prepare the rice

- In a large pot, bring a generous amount of water to a boil. Add the whole spices from the Biryani Masala along with two dry bay leaves. Add about 1 tablespoon of salt. Once the water boils, remove the whole spices and add the drained rice. Keep the heat high initially, then lower to medium once the water bubbles. Stir gently from time to time. Taste frequently: the rice needs to be 70% cooked, still slightly chewy but not too chewy. Once 70% cooked, turn off the heat, drain the rice, discard bay leaves, and gently spread out the rice with a fork.

### Cook the chicken and assemble

- Heat ghee in a large, wide, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the marinated chicken and two dry bay leaves. Stir on medium heat until the juices come to a boil. Then, stir on high heat for 10 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of garam masala powder. Cover with a lid and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through (but not falling off the bone). Skim off the oil from the top of the curry; save it for layering.

- Loosely scatter half of the cooked rice on top. Add some chopped coriander, mint leaves, and the prepared onions. Add the rest of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining chopped coriander, and mint leaves. Pour in the saffron milk mixed with rose water. Add 2-3 whole green/red chilies (optional). Pour the skimmed-off curry oil (or melted ghee) over the layers. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the rest of the browned onions. Place a heavy lid on top.

- Cook on high 5 minutes, then lowest heat for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and rest 30 minutes minimum before opening (longer = fluffier).

- Open the lid and gently spoon out the Biryani using a flat spoon, working from top to bottom to mix the layers. The chicken can be deboned before serving if desired.
