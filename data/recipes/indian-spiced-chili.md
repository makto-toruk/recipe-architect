## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 8-10
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes
- **Cook time:** 35 minutes
- **Pan/Dish size:** Large dutch oven or deep saucepan

## Ingredients

- canola oil (4 tbsp)
- onions (2 medium, diced)
- carrots, diced (4-6)
- celery stalks, diced (4-6)
- garlic paste (2 tsp)
- ginger paste (2 tsp)
- ground cumin (2 tbsp)
- ground coriander (2 tbsp)
- garam masala (2 tsp)
- chili powder (2 tsp)
- 2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional)
- bay leaves (2 dried)
- 6 Thai chilis or 2 jalapenos (optional, adjust to heat preference)
- 1-2 adobo chilis, chopped (adjust to taste)
- paneer (2 lbs, crumbled)
- 4 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 (14.5 oz) cans kidney beans, undrained
- Salt, (to taste)

## Instructions

- Heat oil in a large dutch oven or deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until vegetables start to soften, about 7-8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger paste, continuing to cook for 2 more minutes.

- Add cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, dried fenugreek leaves (if using), bay leaves, Thai chilis/jalapenos (if using), and chopped adobo chilis. Begin adding water a few drops at a time, until you have a thick spice paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

- Add crumbled paneer and mix thoroughly into the spice mixture, coating all the pieces well. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- Add the diced tomatoes and kidney beans, including all the liquid. Stir to combine, then bring pan to a boil. Let it boil for 2-3 minutes, then turn heat down to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 25-30 minutes.

- Taste for salt and add as needed. Remove bay leaves before serving.

## Serving

Serve hot with rice, naan, or cornbread. Garnish with fresh cilantro, a dollop of yogurt or sour cream, and sliced green onions if desired.

## Notes

- The adobo chili adds a smoky, tangy heat. Start with 1 chili and add more to taste.
- If you prefer a saucier chili, add 1-2 cups of vegetable broth or water during simmering.
- Paneer can be browned in a separate pan before adding if you prefer a firmer texture.
- Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days and freeze beautifully for up to 3 months.
- For a vegan version, substitute firm tofu or chickpeas for the paneer.
