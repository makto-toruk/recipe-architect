## Ingredients

- Oil (4 Tbsp)
- Onions (2 medium, diced)
- Carrots (4-6, diced)
- Celery stalks (4-6, diced)
- Garlic paste (2 Tbsp)
- Ginger paste (2 Tbsp)
- Ground cumin (2 Tbsp)
- Ground coriander (2 Tbsp)
- Garam masala (2 tsp)
- Chili powder (2 tsp)
- Jalapenos (3)
- Adobo chilis (1-2, chopped)
- Paneer (1 lb, crumbled)
- Diced tomatoes (3 cans)
- Kidney beans (3 cans)
- Salt (to taste)

## Instructions

- Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until vegetables start to soften, about 7-8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger paste, continuing to cook for 2 more minutes.

- Add cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, jalapenos, and chopped adobo chilis. Begin adding water a few drops at a time, until you have a thick spice paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

- Add crumbled paneer and mix thoroughly into the spice mixture, coating all the pieces well. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- Add the diced tomatoes and kidney beans, including all the liquid. Stir to combine, then bring pan to a boil. Let it boil for 2-3 minutes, then turn heat down to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 25-30 minutes.

- Taste for salt and add as needed. Remove bay leaves before serving.

## Notes

- The adobo chili adds a smoky, tangy heat. Start with 1 chili and add more to taste.
- If you prefer a saucier chili, add 1-2 cups of vegetable broth or water during simmering.
- Paneer can be browned in a separate pan before adding if you prefer a firmer texture.
- Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days and freeze beautifully for up to 3 months.
- For a vegan version, substitute firm tofu or chickpeas for the paneer.
