## Ingredients

### For the lentil filling:

- Green lentils (1 2/3 cups)
- Vegetable broth (5 cups, optional)
- Oil (2 Tbsp)
- Onion (1 medium, diced)
- Garlic cloves (1 bulb, minced)
- Mushrooms (2 boxes, 8oz boxes sliced)
- Carrots (8, diced)
- Porcini powder (3 tsp, or umami TJ seasoning blend)
- Paprika (2 tsp)
- Red chilli powder (2 tsp, optional)
- Tomato paste (5 Tbsp)
- Red wine (5 Tbsp, or substitute 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar)
- Frozen peas (1 cup)
- Salt and black pepper (to taste)

### For the sweet potato mash:

- Sweet potatoes (4 large, peeled and quartered)
- Butter (2 Tbsp)
- Coconut milk (1/2 cup)
- Garlic powder (2 tsp, or minced garlic)
- Onion powder (2 tsp, or diced onions)
- Fresh rosemary (1 Tbsp, or 2 tsp dried)
- Red chilli powder (1 tsp, optional)
- Salt and black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

- Place quartered sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook uncovered for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender. Drain thoroughly.

- While sweet potatoes cook, cook the green lentils in 5 cups of vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 18-20 minutes until lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain any excess liquid and set aside.

- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

- Add mushrooms, carrots, porcini powder, paprika, and chilli powder to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes until vegetables are tender and mushrooms release their liquid.

- Stir in tomato paste and red wine. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

- Gradually add water (1 to 2 cups) until mixture reaches a thick, gravy-like consistency.

  - The mixture should be saucy but not soupy - it will thicken further in the oven.

- Add cooked green lentils and frozen peas to the skillet. Stir to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat.

- When sweet potatoes are done and drained, return them to the pot. Add butter, garlic, onion, and rosemary, and begin mashing. Gradually pour in the coconut milk a little at a time while mashing until you reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

- Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread lentil mixture evenly in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with sweet potato mash, spreading to cover completely.

- Bake for 20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
