## Ingredients

### For the lentil filling:

- Dried brown lentils (1 2/3 cups)
- Vegetable broth (5-7 cups, divided)
- Olive oil (1 Tbsp)
- Onion (1 medium, diced)
- Garlic cloves (10, minced)
- Mushrooms (2 cups, sliced)
- Carrots (4 medium, diced)
- Porcini powder (2-3 tsp)
- Paprika (1 1/2 tsp)
- Tomato paste (5 Tbsp)
- Red wine (5 Tbsp, or substitute 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar)
- Frozen peas (3/4 cup)
- Salt and black pepper (to taste)

### For the sweet potato mash:

- Sweet potatoes (4 lbs, peeled and quartered)
- Butter (1/3 cup)
- Coconut milk (3/4 cup to 1 cup)
- Garlic powder (2 Tbsp, or minced garlic)
- Onion powder (2 Tbsp, or diced onions)
- Fresh rosemary (2 Tbsp minced, or 2 tsp dried)
- Salt and black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

- Place quartered sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook uncovered for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender. Drain thoroughly.

- While sweet potatoes cook, rinse brown lentils and combine with 5 cups vegetable broth in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 18-20 minutes until lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain any excess liquid and set aside.

- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

- Add mushrooms, carrots, porcini powder, and paprika to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes until vegetables are tender and mushrooms release their liquid.

- Stir in tomato paste and red wine. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

- Gradually add remaining broth (1 to 2 cups) until mixture reaches a thick, gravy-like consistency.

  - The mixture should be saucy but not soupy - it will thicken further in the oven.

- Add cooked brown lentils and frozen peas to the skillet. Stir to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat.

- When sweet potatoes are done and drained, return them to the pot. Add butter, garlic, onion, and rosemary, and begin mashing. Gradually pour in the coconut milk a little at a time while mashing until you reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

- Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread lentil mixture evenly in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with sweet potato mash, spreading to cover completely.

- Bake for 20-25 minutes until the sweet potato topping is lightly golden. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
