## Ingredients

- Olive oil (2 Tbsp)
- Onions (2 medium, diced)
- Carrots (2 medium, diced)
- Celery stalks (4-6, diced)
- Garlic cloves (4-6, finely chopped)
- Bay leaves (4)
- Chicken breasts (4, about 24 oz total)
- Chicken stock (12 cups)
- Farro (1 1/2 cups)
- Lemon juice (2 lemons)
- Egg yolks (4)
- Fresh dill (2 handfuls)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

- Heat the olive oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven and cook the onion, carrot and celery for 8-10 minutes over medium heat until softened.

- Add the garlic and cook for another minute, then add the bay leaves, chicken and chicken stock.

- Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and simmer for 15 minutes.

- Take out the chicken breasts and bay leaves. Add the farro to the pot and continue to cook for 20-30 minutes until tender (check package instructions for your specific farro type).

- Shred the chicken with two forks and add it back to the pot.

- While the farro is cooking, whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice in a bowl. Take out 1-2 ladles of soup and pour it over the egg-lemon mixture to temper it. Add this mix to the pot and continue to cook for 5 minutes.

- Stir in the fresh dill, adjust the seasoning and serve immediately, with some extra fresh dill on top if you like.
