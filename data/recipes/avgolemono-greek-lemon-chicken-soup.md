## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 8-10 (doubled for meal prep)
- **Prep time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook time:** 40 minutes
- **Pan/Dish size:** Large stock pot or Dutch oven

## Ingredients

- olive oil (2 tablespoons)
- onions (2 medium, diced)
- carrots (2 medium, diced)
- celery stalks, diced (4-6)
- garlic cloves, finely chopped (4-6)
- leaves (4 bay)
- 4 chicken breasts (about 24 oz / 700 g total)
- 12 cups (3 liters) chicken stock
- 1 1/2 cups (350 g) farro
- Juice of 2 lemons
- yolks (4 egg)
- fresh dill (2 handfuls)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

- Heat the olive oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven and cook the onion, carrot and celery for 8-10 minutes over medium heat until softened.

- Add the garlic and cook for another minute, then add the bay leaves, chicken and chicken stock.

- Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and simmer for 15 minutes.

- Take out the chicken breasts and bay leaves. Add the farro to the pot and continue to cook for 20-30 minutes until tender (check package instructions for your specific farro type).

- Shred the chicken with two forks and add it back to the pot.

- While the farro is cooking, whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice in a bowl. Take out 1-2 ladles of soup and pour it over the egg-lemon mixture to temper it. Add this mix to the pot and continue to cook for 5 minutes.

- Stir in the fresh dill, adjust the seasoning and serve immediately, with some extra fresh dill on top if you like.

## Notes

This recipe has been doubled from the original for meal prepping. Farro has been substituted for orzo - it provides a heartier texture and holds up better when reheating. Avgolemono is a traditional Greek lemon chicken soup that's comforting and satisfying with bright lemon flavor balanced by creamy egg yolks.
