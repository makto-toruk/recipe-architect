## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 6-8
- **Prep time:** 15-20 minutes
- **Cook time:** 40-50 minutes
- **Pan/Dish size:** 10 inch skillet

## Ingredients

- Unsalted butter (1 stick)
- Fresh rosemary (2 sprigs)
- Garlic cloves (2, smashed and peeled)
- Medium potatoes (3 lbs, German butter ball or Yukon Gold recommended, peeled)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Special Equipment

- Small saucepan
- Non-stick skillet (oven-safe)
- Mandolin
- Oyster shucking glove (optional, for mandolin safety)
- Dutch oven or another heavy, oven-safe object for weighting
- Baking sheet or foil (optional, for catching butter drips)
- Cake tester, skewer, or toothpick
- Serrated knife

## Instructions

- In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the rosemary sprigs and smashed garlic cloves. Let it come to a gentle simmer and infuse while you prepare the potatoes. Do not brown the butter.

- Peel the potatoes and hold in room temperature tap water. Using a mandolin, thinly slice one potato at a time. The slices should be flexible but not paper-thin. Using an oyster shucking glove can provide safety when using the mandolin.

- Brush a thin layer of the infused butter on the bottom of your non-stick skillet. For the first layer, arrange potato slices in a rosette pattern, starting from the center and building outward, overlapping tightly (this will be the top when inverted). Drizzle more infused butter over the first layer, then season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue layering potato slices, butter, salt, and pepper (about 5 layers total). For subsequent layers, you don't need to be as precise with the pattern, but ensure even layers. Finish with a final layer of butter and seasoning. Optional: tuck in a few rosemary leaves or garlic cloves between slices.

- Place the skillet on the burner over medium-high heat. Cook until the bottom layer of potatoes is golden brown. The potatoes will soften and release steam, causing the cake to settle.

- Cover the skillet with foil. Place a heavy object (such as a Dutch oven without lid) on top of the foil to compress the potatoes. Bake at 375°F for 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and creamy throughout. Test doneness by inserting a cake tester, skewer, or toothpick into the center. Consider placing the skillet on a baking sheet to catch any butter drips.

- Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Remove the weight and foil. Let the Pommes Anna cool for at least 10 minutes in the skillet before unmolding to allow the starches to set and prevent hot butter from dripping.

- If the cake slides easily in the skillet, place a platter over the skillet and carefully invert the Pommes Anna onto the platter. If it doesn't slide, use a spatula to loosen it. Use a serrated knife to cut through the crispy top layer. Serve immediately.

## Notes

The potato absorbs a lot of butter during cooking. You might want a little more butter on top or a drizzle when serving for extra richness. This is a beautiful and delicious side dish, perfect for any festive meal.
