## Ingredients

- Cauliflower (1 head, cut into small florets)
- White miso paste (2 Tbsp)
- Oil (1 Tbsp)
- Soy sauce (1 Tbsp, or tamari)
- Rice wine vinegar (1 Tbsp)
- Red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp)
- Cilantro (2 Tbsp, optional; for garnish)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 400°F.

- Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease.

- Whisk together miso paste, oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper flakes in a mason jar.

- Toss cauliflower with the miso mixture and spread in a single layer on the baking sheet.

- Roast for 20-25 minutes.

  - When I made this the first time, some of the miso mixture burnt on the sheet. Next time, I'll brush the mixture on mid-way through baking.

- Toss with fresh cilantro and serve immediately.
