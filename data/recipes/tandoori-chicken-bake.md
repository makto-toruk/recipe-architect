## Ingredients

### For the marinade:

- Chicken (3.3 lb, bone-in skin-on thighs)
- Buttermilk (1 1/2 cups, or substitute: 1 cup plain yogurt + 1/3 cup water)
- Ginger-garlic paste (1 Tbsp)
- Tandoori masala (1 Tbsp)
- Light brown sugar (1/2 Tbsp, optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper (1/4 tsp)
- Garam masala powder (1 tsp)
- Ground cumin (1 tsp, jeera)
- Ground coriander (1 tsp, dhania)
- Kasoori methi (1 tsp, crushed dried fenugreek leaves)
- Sweet paprika (1 tsp, or Kashmiri red chilli powder for color)
- Salt (1 tsp or to taste, adjust based on salt in your tandoori masala)

### For cooking:

- Onion (1 large, sliced)
- Ghee (for searing)
- Whole chillies (2-3, slit, optional)

## Instructions

- In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, ginger-garlic paste, tandoori masala, brown sugar, black pepper, garam masala, ground cumin, ground coriander, kasoori methi, paprika, and salt. Mix well. Add chicken thighs and coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 12 hours. Remove from the fridge 1 hour before cooking to bring to room temperature.

  - Don't go over 12 hours—the meat may become mushy

- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ghee. Working in batches if needed, sear chicken skin-side down for 5 minutes until golden brown. Flip and sear the other side for 5 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) or 375°F (190°C) if using convection. Lightly oil a steel baking tray or cast iron casserole pot. Add sliced onions to the base. Place seared chicken on top of onions. Add slit chillies to the pan.

- Bake for about 30 minutes until chicken reaches safe internal temperature (180°F for fall-off-the-bone texture).

- Turn oven to broil and broil for 2 minutes to crisp up the skin. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
  - For someone like me who is incapable of multi-tasking, it's essential to not step away no matter how tempting it might seem.
