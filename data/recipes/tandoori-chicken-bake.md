### Other Ingredients:

- / 1 medium to large onion (210 gm, sliced)
- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (or finely grate 2-inch piece ginger + 8-9 garlic cloves)
- 4 tbsp melted butter (divided) (or use ghee/oil)
- Whole chillies (optional)
- 1 tsp paprika mixed with butter (for basting)
- Fresh thyme or parsley or coriander for garnish

### To Thicken Gravy (Optional):

- cornstarch (1 tbsp)
- water (2 tbsp)

## Instructions

### 1. Marinate the Chicken

- In a bowl, combine chicken thighs with buttermilk (or yogurt mixture)
- Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 12 hours
- **Tip:** Don't go over 12 hours—the meat may become mushy
- Remove from the fridge 1 hour before cooking to bring to room temperature

### 2. Make the Spice Rub

In a small bowl, mix:

- Tandoori masala
- Brown sugar
- Black pepper
- Garam masala
- Ground cumin
- Ground coriander
- Kasoori methi
- Salt
- Paprika

Set aside.

### 3. Prepare to Bake

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) or 375°F (190°C) if using convection
- Lightly oil a steel baking tray or cast iron casserole pot
- Add sliced onions to the base
- Place only the chicken into the dish (discard the marinade)
- Add ginger-garlic paste, the spice rub, and 1 tbsp melted butter
- Mix well so every piece is coated

### 4. Bake the Chicken

Bake for 1 hour total:

**At 30-minute mark:**

- Mix remaining melted butter with 1 tsp sweet paprika
- Baste the chicken with this mixture
- Return to oven

**At 50-minute mark:**

- Baste again
- Add whole chillies and sprinkle with fresh thyme (optional)
- Bake final 10 minutes

### 5. (Optional) Thicken the Gravy

- Mix cornstarch and water into a slurry
- Once chicken is done, place the pan on the stove over high heat
- Stir in the slurry and let the gravy boil for 1 minute
- Spoon the thickened gravy over the chicken to coat

## Serving

- Check internal temp of thighs: 180°F or higher is perfect
- Sprinkle with chopped parsley or coriander
- Serve hot with naan, rice, or even mashed potatoes

## Notes

Tender, tandoori masala spiced chicken thighs baked with onions and aromatic spices. The buttermilk marinade helps tenderize the meat while the spice rub creates a flavorful crust.
