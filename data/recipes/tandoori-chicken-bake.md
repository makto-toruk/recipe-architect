## Recipe Details

- **Servings:** 5-6
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes (plus 3-12 hours marinating)
- **Cook time:** 1 hour

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken Marinade:

- / 3.3 lb bone-in (1.5 kg, skin-on chicken thighs)
- 1½ cups buttermilk (or substitute: 1 cup plain yogurt + ⅓ cup water)

### For the Spice Rub:

- 1 tbsp tandoori masala (start with ½ tbsp if yours is spicy)
- ½ tbsp light brown sugar (optional)
- ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- garam masala powder (1 tsp)
- 1 tsp ground cumin (jeera)
- 1 tsp ground coriander (dhania)
- 1 tsp kasoori methi (crushed dried fenugreek leaves)
- 1 tsp sweet paprika (or Kashmiri red chilli powder for color)
- 1 tsp salt or to taste (adjust based on salt in your tandoori masala)

### Other Ingredients:

- / 1 medium to large onion (210 gm, sliced)
- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (or finely grate 2-inch piece ginger + 8-9 garlic cloves)
- 4 tbsp melted butter (divided) (or use ghee/oil)
- Whole chillies (optional)
- 1 tsp paprika mixed with butter (for basting)
- Fresh thyme or parsley or coriander for garnish

### To Thicken Gravy (Optional):

- cornstarch (1 tbsp)
- water (2 tbsp)

## Instructions

- In a bowl, combine chicken thighs with buttermilk (or yogurt mixture). Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 12 hours (don't go over 12 hours—the meat may become mushy). Remove from the fridge 1 hour before cooking to bring to room temperature.

- In a small bowl, mix tandoori masala, brown sugar, black pepper, garam masala, ground cumin, ground coriander, kasoori methi, salt, and paprika. Set aside.

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) or 375°F (190°C) if using convection. Lightly oil a steel baking tray or cast iron casserole pot. Add sliced onions to the base. Place only the chicken into the dish (discard the marinade). Add ginger-garlic paste, the spice rub, and 1 tbsp melted butter. Mix well so every piece is coated.

- Bake for 1 hour total. At 30-minute mark, mix remaining melted butter with 1 tsp sweet paprika, baste the chicken with this mixture, and return to oven. At 50-minute mark, baste again, add whole chillies and sprinkle with fresh thyme (optional), and bake final 10 minutes.

- (Optional) Mix cornstarch and water into a slurry. Once chicken is done, place the pan on the stove over high heat. Stir in the slurry and let the gravy boil for 1 minute. Spoon the thickened gravy over the chicken to coat.

## Serving

- Check internal temp of thighs: 180°F or higher is perfect
- Sprinkle with chopped parsley or coriander
- Serve hot with naan, rice, or even mashed potatoes

## Notes

Tender, tandoori masala spiced chicken thighs baked with onions and aromatic spices. The buttermilk marinade helps tenderize the meat while the spice rub creates a flavorful crust.
