## Ingredients

- White button mushrooms (2 8oz boxes)
- Green peas (1/4 cup)
- Onion (1/2, finely chopped)
- Tomato paste (2 Tbsp)
- Ginger garlic paste (1 tsp)
- Green chili (1, slit, optional)
- Curry leaves (1-2 sprigs)
- Cumin seeds (1/2 tsp)
- Oil (2 Tbsp)
- Red chili powder (3/4 tsp)
- Turmeric (1/8 tsp)
- Garam masala (1 tsp)
- Salt (to taste)
- Lemon juice (1 tsp, optional)

## Instructions

- Prepare all ingredients: finely chop onion, slit the green chili, and rinse peas.

- Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sputter. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté briefly.

- Add onions and green chili. Stir-fry until onions turn golden brown. Meanwhile, rinse and chop mushrooms into quarters or halves.

- Add tomato paste and stir-fry for about a minute until it darkens slightly and the raw smell dissipates.

- Add red chili powder, garam masala, curry leaves, and turmeric. Sauté until aromatic, about 30 seconds.

- Add mushrooms, peas, and salt. Stir-fry on high heat until fragrant.

  - Reduce heat if the mixture starts sticking. Stir constantly until mushrooms are tender but not soggy.
  - If mushrooms release too much moisture, increase the flame to evaporate it quickly.

- Remove from heat. Taste and adjust salt. Add lemon juice if desired.

- Serve hot with rice or chapati or in tacos(!)
