# About This Project

Most recipe websites feel noisy and transactional. They interrupt more than they invite. This project began as a personal response to that. A quieter way to keep and share the recipes that matter.

Writing these recipes down and sharing them is also a way to honor those who came before me. And a way to celebrate my wife's creativity with flavors.

I’ve come to value the calm that comes with focus. The discipline of cutting away what isn’t essential. This recipe book is part of that discipline.

I love building things. This was a chance to build something that I would love to use. It was also a chance to learn something new.

[The right data architecture](https://github.com/makto-toruk/recipe-architect) has always felt like the foundation for great products. I wanted another way to test this.

Maybe our children (we don't have any yet) will cook from it. Maybe the robots of the future will. In either case, I wanted to leave something behind that felt considered.
